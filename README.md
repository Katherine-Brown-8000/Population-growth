# Population-growth

Show population growth based on 7 factors
1. Time
2. lifespan
3. start of reproductive age
4. end of reproductive age
5. initial population
6. reproductive rate
7. mortality rate

I realize there are ways to make this code more accurate for a real population, but it was useful for an estimate.
